              <p>I have been attending the Practicum bootcamp since November 2022 
                and have gained experience in Git, GitHub, HTML, and CSS. 
                In addition, I have independently learned some JavaScript by creating my 
                first launch project called 'After All'.

            <ul>
              <p>This is a dating/self-improvement web page that I created to practice 
                using forms and JavaScript. With the help of Google and ChatGPT, 
                I was able to build this project, which you can find on my GitHub repository:

            <ul>
              <p>On the mobile front, I'm developing a mobile app that uses an Elo ranking 
                system to rate tennis, golf, and padel players. The app will allow players 
                to find others to play with and help them book courts.
